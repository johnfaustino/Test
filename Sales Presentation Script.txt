First, there's the 'Attended Robot.' Think of it as your digital sidekick, always ready to assist with everyday tasks across various apps and systems

Next, the 'Unattended Robot.' These bots excel at automating task-heavy, long-running workflows.

"Then, we have the 'Automation Cloud™ Robot.' This is your go-to option when you need automation without worrying about infrastructure

Finally, the 'Test Robot.' This one is designed for testing both robots and applications to ensure their reliability


[Slide 8]

Let's take a closer look at 'Automation Suite.'

It’s the ‘Automation Cloud’ experience, but you run the show​

With Automation Suite, you get the entire UiPath Business Automation Platform — or as much of it as you need — bundled into one package. Here's the key:
